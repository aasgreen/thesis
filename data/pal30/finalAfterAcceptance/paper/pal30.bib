The observed polarizations agree with the clock model of chiral smectic-C variants, and rule out other proposals made to date for these structures. Data from the 10OTBBB1M7 racemate also support the clock model. Our resonant diffraction results from a thiophene liquid-crystal compound reveal the same superlattice periodicities seen in corresponding antiferroelectric and ferrielectric phases of 10OTBBB1M7.},

	abstract = {The use of resonant X-ray scattering to determine structures in liquid crystal systems is surveyed. This powerful experimental technique utilises “forbidden reflections” to determine the subtle differences in interlayer orientation that differentiate several smectic systems. The technique relies on the materials containing an atom to which the X-ray energy can be tuned, usually sulphur or selenium. Experiments are often carried out on free-standing films that provide a highly monodomain structure that allows high-resolution measurements to be made, and, hence, structural details to be determined. Alternatively, resonant scattering has been demonstrated for materials contained in glass devices that permit the application of electric fields to the system, in a manner analogous to that used in liquid crystal devices. The resonant scattering technique provides unequivocal descriptions of the packing in smectic systems, and the way in which the packing is distorted in electric fields. This Minireview describes the principles behind resonant X-ray scattering, its application to liquid crystals and some of the potential for the future.},

Assuming a familiarity with the basics of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, the book establishes a general framework for describing condensed phases of matter, based on symmetries and conservation laws. It explores the role of spatial dimensionality and microscopic interactions in determining the nature of phase transitions, as well as discussing the structure and properties of materials with different symmetries. Particular attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods. The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids, magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of their symmetry, generalised rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect structure. In addition to serving as a course text, this book is an essential reference for students and researchers in physics, applied physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, who are interested in modern condensed matter physics.},

The electric-field-induced transformations in the SmAP(X) phase give rise to two biaxial states separated by a uniaxial one. The second harmonic electro-optic response in this phase is interpreted in terms of the polar interaction with the electric field. A comparison of the experimental results with the next-nearest-neighbor model for the structure of the SmAP(X) phase shows it to be an SmAP(α) phase.},

  abstract={Helical structures were confirmed for both the SmA b and SmBlue phases of banana-shaped molecular systems from observations of the microscopic fringe pattern and the selective reflection of blue color, respectively. X-ray and optical microscopy indicate that the helical axes in the SmA b and SmBlue phases are normal and parallel to the smectic layer, respectively. In these two helical phases, 13 C NMR spectra show two C=O peaks, suggesting two different configurations of ester group, whereas only one C=O peak appears in the isotropic and crystal phases. This indicates that the two C=O groups in the mesogenic core are not in the same plane but are twisted. The addition of chiral dopant makes the dichroic ratio of the right- and left-circularly polarized scattered light positive or negative in the SmBlue phase, although the wavelength (∼430 nm) of the scattering peak does not change significantly. The origin of the helix will be discussed in view of the twisted molecular conformation (conformational chirality) and the escape from macroscopic polarization.}

Recent x-ray scattering experiments suggest that, in a class of siloxane-containing liquid crystals, an electric field changes a state of disordered molecular tilt in random directions into a state of ordered tilt in one direction. To investigate this issue, we measure the optical tilt and birefringence of these liquid crystals as functions of field and temperature, and we develop a theory for the distribution of molecular orientations under a field. A comparison of theory and experiment confirms that these materials have a disordered distribution of molecular tilt directions that is aligned by an electric field, giving a large electroclinic effect. It also shows that the effective dipole moment, a key parameter in the theory, scales as a power law near the smectic-A\textendash{}smectic-C transition.},

  abstract = {Packing Bananas and Boomerangs
Assembling achiral molecules typically generates achiral domains. However, odd things can happen when the molecules are banana-or boomerang-shaped\textemdash{}their cores can twist out of plain to form left- or right-handed helices, which can then pack into chiral domains that will polarize light (see the Perspective by Amabilino). Hough et al. (p. 452) show that if you make the situation even more complex by frustrating the packing of adjacent layers, you can create a material that appears to be macroscopically isotropic with only very local positional and orientational ordering of the molecules but still shows an overall chirality. In a second paper, Hough et al. (p. 456) also show that if you change the chemistry of the molecules to allow for better overall packing, you can create a situation where helical filaments form that also tend to pack in layered structures. However, the frustration between the two types of packing leads to macroscopically chiral and mesoporous structures.
A variety of simple bent-core molecules exhibit smectic liquid crystal phases of planar fluid layers that are spontaneously both polar and chiral in the absence of crystalline order. We found that because of intralayer structural mismatch, such layers are also only marginally stable against spontaneous saddle splay deformation, which is incompatible with long-range order. This results in macroscopically isotropic fluids that possess only short-range orientational and positional order, in which the only macroscopically broken symmetry is chirality\textemdash{}even though the phases are formed from achiral molecules. Their conglomerate domains exhibit optical rotatory powers comparable to the highest ever found for isotropic fluids of chiral molecules.
Banana-shaped molecules lacking handedness form a macroscopically isotropic fluid that still has overall chirality.

abstract  ={Bent-core molecules based on a resorcinol bisbenzoate core with a series of distinct substituents in different positions at the central resorcinol core have been synthesized and characterized. The focus is on the effect of branched terminal groups in the racemic and chiral forms on the mesomorphic properties. These were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry{,} optical polarizing microscopy{,} X-ray diffraction{,} electro-optic and dielectric methods. Only bent-core mesogens derived from 4-cyanoresorcinol exhibit liquid crystalline phases and the mesophases of these compounds are strongly influenced by the branching and enantiomeric composition of the terminal chains. Depending on the structure of the rod-like wings and the enantiomeric composition{,} cybotactic nematic phases (NcybC){,} BPIII-like isotropic mesophases (BPIIIcybC*) and various polar and apolar smectic phases (SmA{,} SmC{,} SmC*{,} SmCsPA{,} SmCsPA*) are formed. For one compound{,} a de Vries type smectic phase is observed and it appears that with decreasing temperature{,} order develops in two steps. First{,} at the SmA to SmC transition{,} the tilt direction becomes long range ordered and in a second step a long range ordering in bend direction takes place. Hence{,} for the optically active compound a transition from chirality induced polar switching to bend induced (shape induced) antiferroelectricity takes place. In this SmCsPA* phase a homogeneous layer chirality is induced under an applied electric field which interacts with the fixed molecular chirality leading to the energetically favoured diastereomeric state and giving rise to a field direction dependent uniform tilt director orientation. Field reversal induces a flipping of the layer chirality{,} which first leads to the less favorable diastereomeric state{,} and then this slowly relaxes to the more stable one by a spontaneous reversal of the tilt direction.}

First thoughts: I think they have the helical phase wrong. I think that the helical phase is their SmCsPr phase, and that what they call their helical phase might be just a SmCaPf phase-- like what we see. I would have to really sit down with their nature comm paper and think about it though.

abstract="Liquid crystals are soft materials that combine the fluidity of disordered liquids and the long range orientational or positional order of crystalline solids along one or two directions of space. X-ray scattering is widely and generally successfully used to investigate and characterize the microscopic structure of most liquid crystals. In many cases however, the Bragg reflections are forbidden by special symmetries of the unit cell and the low dimensional structure of the liquid crystalline phases are out of reach of conventional X-ray experiments. We show in this paper that this problem can be overcome by resonant scattering of X-rays as it reveals the anisotropy of the tensor structure factor. We review various examples in which the restored forbidden reflections reveal unambiguously the hidden structure of liquid crystalline phases. Moreover, we show that in some cases, a fine analysis of the polarization of the Bragg reflections enables one to discriminate between different structural models. These studies solved long standing questions about biaxial liquid crystal structures and provided new insights into physical phenomena such as supercritical behaviour or commensurate-incommensurate transitions.",
