Lifting the degeneracy by external fields two additional structures of the Sm X phase are possible.},

The bulk states are either antiferroelectric-racemic, with the layer polar direction and handedness alternating in sign from layer to layer, or antiferroelectric-chiral, which is of uniform layer handedness. Both states exhibit an electric field–induced transition from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric.},

  abstract = {Now in paperback, this book provides an overview of the physics of condensed matter systems. Assuming a familiarity with the basics of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, the book establishes a general framework for describing condensed phases of matter, based on symmetries and conservation laws. It explores the role of spatial dimensionality and microscopic interactions in determining the nature of phase transitions, as well as discussing the structure and properties of materials with different symmetries. Particular attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods. The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids, magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of their symmetry, generalised rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect structure. In addition to serving as a course text, this book is an essential reference for students and researchers in physics, applied physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, who are interested in modern condensed matter physics.},

It shows a novel sequence of four nontilted or orthogonal smectic phases on cooling: SmA-SmAP(R)-SmAP(X)-SmAP(A). Here SmAP(X) is the new orthogonal polar uniaxial smectic phase. The electric-field-induced transformations in the SmAP(X) phase give rise to two biaxial states separated by a uniaxial one. The second harmonic electro-optic response in this phase is interpreted in terms of the polar interaction with the electric field. A comparison of the experimental results with the next-nearest-neighbor model for the structure of the SmAP(X) phase shows it to be an SmAP(α) phase.},

  abstract = {Brief history of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric liquid crystals is described. To reduce the symmetry of the molecular systems, two ideas were successfully used; introductions of chirality and molecular shape asymmetry. The chirality introduced into rod-shaped and disc-shaped molecular systems led to chiral smectic C and chiral discotic columnar phases. Dogleg from rod and cone or bowl from disc in molecular shapes brought about polar organization by their packing, realizing so-called banana phases and polar columnar phases, respectively. Particularly, bent-core mesogens exhibit a variety of novel polar phases. In addition to such established polar structures, some evidences about polar structures realized in polar nematic and cholesteric phases are given in some detail. Attempts for the application of these polar liquid crystals such as displays are also overviewed.},

Optical tilt angle (θ) in the SmC phase and induced tilt angle (θind) in the SmA* phase produced by the electroclinic effect have been determined. Ps has been fitted on Ps = 27.32(Tc-T)044nC/cm2 below the Curie temperature Tc = 51.4°C. Ps is screened by the space charge from 25 to 35°C. ts lies in the range of 36 to 2 ms and varies inversely with E above a critical field Ec.

Spontaneous polarisations, rotational viscosities, relaxation frequencies, dielectric strengths and distribution parameters were determined as a function of temperature. The electric field required for saturation of the spontaneous polarisation increased with a decrease in temperature. In the SmA* phase, only one relaxation mechanism was observed that behaves as soft mode. Two relaxation processes were detected in the SmC* phase. A high‐frequency relaxation process invariant at 2.2 kHz was due to a Goldstone mode, but the origin of low‐frequency relaxation process (1–20 Hz) is unclear; however, it may belong to an X‐mode. The dielectric spectrum of the SmCA* phase exhibits two absorption peaks separated by two decades of frequency. The low‐frequency peak is related to the antiferroelectric Goldstone mode, whereas the high‐frequency peak originates from the anti‐phase fluctuation of the directors in the anti‐tilt pairs of the SmCA* phase.},

A model for the system is presented and analyzed for the two cases of square-wave and sinusoidal voltage applied to a ‘‘bookshelf geometry’’ sample, where the smectic layers are oriented relative to the glass plates as books are to a shelf. The model gives a good description for the observed polarization reversal current and yields the rotational viscosity and one effective elastic constant in addition to the spontaneous polarization. Relations between these parameters and the width of the observed hysteresis loop are derived as well as relations for the contribution of the ferroelectric polarization to the permittivity.

SmCα*, SmCβ*, SmCγ* and many others with distinct macroscopic properties in a narrow temperature region in addition to the most common wide-range low-temperature SmCa* phase.

  abstract = {Smectic liquid crystals consisting of achiral bent-core molecules may be polar due to asymmetric packing of the molecules. Recently it was proposed that the planes of the molecules are tilted with respect to the smectic layers and the structure is chiral. The ground state is antiferroelectric and the majority of the films are racemic with the same tilt direction in the subsequent layers. Basically the tilt directions are equivalent, and stripes with oppositely tilted molecules exist. In this paper we show that it is possible to suppress the formation of the stripes, and to obtain a uniform texture in thin films. In uniform racemic textures, weak quadratic electro-optical switching can be observed. Voltage dependences of the switching are measured and the switching mechanisms are discussed.},

Although experimental observations ruled out the simply modulated ferrielectric structure as well as the incommensurate structure, the analysis of the model can still be important for similar systems.},

Though the SmAdPR phase appears to be optically uniaxial as that of the SmA phase, the observed distinctive properties of the SmAdPR phase are (a) a current peak associated with a polarisation reorientation process under the application of a triangular wave voltage, (b) large variation of the effective birefringence of the planarly oriented sample with the applied in-plane electric field and (c) the presence of a strong dielectric mode. We have developed a simple theoretical model to describe the observed properties of the SmAPR phase and the transition from the SmAPR to the SmAPA phase. We propose that the above characteristic properties of the SmAPR phase arise due to the strong coupling between the transverse polarisation and the transverse polar order of the bend directions of the bent-core molecules in the layers.},

For the texture description a model is proposed consisting of a periodic system of anticlinic antiferroelectric bulk domains with opposite chiralities separated by π walls in which polarization rotates. The bulk domains are situated between layers of synclinic ferroelectric phase near the upper and lower surfaces. In the surface layers induced by polar anchoring domains of opposite chirality are separated by defect lines. Under the electric field the ferroelectric layer near one sample surface is growing against the antiferroelectric structure in the sample bulk and the stripe texture is fading out, but still in the saturated field surface lines or walls persist separating ferroelectric domains of opposite chirality. The proposed model is adapted also for a case when the anticlinic antiferroelectric structure in the sample bulk is sandwiched between anticlinic ferroelectric layers near the surfaces. In that case the applied electric field eliminates all the lines because the resulting anticlinic ferroelectric structure is racemic, with no chiral domains.},

The model assumes a bilayer smectic ordering and a mechanism consisting of an azimuthal reorientation of the molecules at the transitions. Three helicoïdal ferrielectric structures are found to be possibly stable, in which the helical pitch is shown to vary monotonically as a function of temperature. One of these phases, characterized by an azimuthal mode independent from the z coordinate, provides a suitable interpretation of the presently known results on ferrielectric ordering in liquid crystals.

A simple version of the free energy, which contains only the nearest-neighbor and the next-nearest-neighbor layer interactions gives a complete phase diagram with all the observed smectic-C* (SmC*) variant phases. In thin free-standing films, surface ordering may lead to suppression of the bulk SmC*α helix and to formation of planar structures.

We study a model that incorporates thermal fluctuations in the flexing of layers and find that it supports commensurate and incommensurate structures. The vibrational entropy competes with an assumed helical interaction between nearest-neighbor layers. An increase in temperature then leads to an unwinding of the helix that proceeds at first through commensurate phases and then into an incommensurate phase. This result is consistent with the experimentally observed “distorted clock model.”},

  abstract = {Interest in the smectic liquid-crystalline state of matter received a substantial boost with the discovery by Meyer in the mid-1970s that a chiral smectic C (SmC*) phase exhibits a spontaneous electric polarization, and with the subsequent demonstration by Clark and Lagerwall of the surface-stabilized SmC* ferroelectric liquid crystal at the beginning of the 1980s. Since then, chiral smectic phases and their plethora of polar effects have dominated the research in this field, which today has reached a mature state where the first commercial microdisplay applications are now shipping in millions-per-year quantities. In this Review we discuss some of the topics of highest interest in current smectic liquid crystal research, and address application-relevant research (de Vries-type tilting transitions without defect generation and high-tilt antiferroelectric liquid crystals with perfect dark state) as well as more curiosity-driven research (the nature and origin of the chiral smectic C subphases and their intermediate frustrated states between ferro- and antiferroelectricity).},

The mesophase behavior and phase structures are characterized in bulk and freely suspended films using a variety of experimental techniques. Depending on the chain length and temperature a series of different mesophases is observed in these compounds, ranging from cybotactic nematic via paraelectric SmC phases, polarization randomized SmCsPR phases to ferroelectric and antiferroelectric SmC phases, associated with increasing size and correlation length of the polar domains. Spontaneous formation of chiral domains is observed in the paraelectric SmC and the SmCsPR phases and discussed in relation with superstructural chirality, bend elastic constants, and surface effects.},

The continuum theory established by Marcerou (2010) [1] is used to derive an expression for the free energy density of those subphases. The minimization of this free energy is obtained through a combination of analytical and numerical methods. It leads to a phase diagram built in the (α,η) plane where α is local angular parameter and η describes the variation of the temperature. From this graphical representation, many experimentally observed phase sequences of ferroelectric liquid crystals can be explained, even them including subphases which were recently observed like the SmC5⁎ and the SmC6⁎ ones. However, it should be emphasized that the details of predicted phase diagram are strongly dependent on the compound studied.},

  abstract = {A non-layer-shrinkage fluorinated ferroelectric liquid crystal compound, 8422[2F3], has been characterized by means of optical, x-ray, and calorimetric methods. The orientational distribution within macroscopic volumes, determined through wide-angle x-ray scattering and birefringence measurements, was found to be identical in the Sm−A* and helical Sm−C* phases. Together with the absence of layer shrinkage, this constitutes strong evidence that the second-order Sm−A*–Sm−C* transition in this material is well described by the diffuse cone model of de Vries. The absolute values of the layer spacing show that the molecules aggregate to antiparallel pairs. The molecular interaction across the layer boundaries will then occur only between fluorine atoms, leading to unusually weak interlayer tilt direction correlation. This explains the experimental observations of a very easily disturbed Sm−C* helix and a peculiar surface-stabilized texture. Tilt angle and birefringence values as a function of field and temperature have been evaluated in the Sm−A* and Sm−C* phases and the results corroborate the conclusions from the x-ray investigations.},

In particular, I will discuss the formation of helical superstructures in cholesteric, Twist Grain Boundary and ferroelectric phases. As examples for the occurrence of novel phases the Blue Phases and Twist Grain Boundary phases are introduced. Chirality related effects are demonstrated through the occurrence of ferroelectricity in both thermotropic as well as lyotropic liquid crystals. Lack of mirror symmetry is also discussed briefly for some biopolymers such as cellulose and DNA, together with its influence on liquid crystalline behavior.},

  abstract = {The use of resonant X-ray scattering to determine structures in liquid crystal systems is surveyed. This powerful experimental technique utilises “forbidden reflections” to determine the subtle differences in interlayer orientation that differentiate several smectic systems. The technique relies on the materials containing an atom to which the X-ray energy can be tuned, usually sulphur or selenium. Experiments are often carried out on free-standing films that provide a highly monodomain structure that allows high-resolution measurements to be made, and, hence, structural details to be determined. Alternatively, resonant scattering has been demonstrated for materials contained in glass devices that permit the application of electric fields to the system, in a manner analogous to that used in liquid crystal devices. The resonant scattering technique provides unequivocal descriptions of the packing in smectic systems, and the way in which the packing is distorted in electric fields. This Minireview describes the principles behind resonant X-ray scattering, its application to liquid crystals and some of the potential for the future.},

This technique provides a unique structural probe for the ferroelectric, ferrielectric, antiferroelectric, and SmC*α phases. An analysis of the scattering features allows the structural models of the different subphases to be distinguished, in addition to providing a measurement of the helical pitch. This paper reports resonant scattering features in the antiferroelectric hexatic phase, the three- and four-layer intermediate phases, the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases and the SmC*α phase. The helicoidal pitch has been measured from the scattering peaks in the four-layer intermediate phase as well as in the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases. In the SmC*α phase, an investigation into the helical structure has revealed a pitch ranging from 5 to 54 layers in different materials. Further, a strong resonant scattering signal has been observed in mixtures of a selenium containing material with as much as 90\% nonresonant material.},

Recent x-ray scattering experiments suggest that, in a class of siloxane-containing liquid crystals, an electric field changes a state of disordered molecular tilt in random directions into a state of ordered tilt in one direction. To investigate this issue, we measure the optical tilt and birefringence of these liquid crystals as functions of field and temperature, and we develop a theory for the distribution of molecular orientations under a field. A comparison of theory and experiment confirms that these materials have a disordered distribution of molecular tilt directions that is aligned by an electric field, giving a large electroclinic effect. It also shows that the effective dipole moment, a key parameter in the theory, scales as a power law near the smectic-A–smectic-C transition.},

  abstract = {Packing Bananas and Boomerangs
Assembling achiral molecules typically generates achiral domains. However, odd things can happen when the molecules are banana-or boomerang-shaped—their cores can twist out of plain to form left- or right-handed helices, which can then pack into chiral domains that will polarize light (see the Perspective by Amabilino). Hough et al. (p. 452) show that if you make the situation even more complex by frustrating the packing of adjacent layers, you can create a material that appears to be macroscopically isotropic with only very local positional and orientational ordering of the molecules but still shows an overall chirality. In a second paper, Hough et al. (p. 456) also show that if you change the chemistry of the molecules to allow for better overall packing, you can create a situation where helical filaments form that also tend to pack in layered structures. However, the frustration between the two types of packing leads to macroscopically chiral and mesoporous structures.
A variety of simple bent-core molecules exhibit smectic liquid crystal phases of planar fluid layers that are spontaneously both polar and chiral in the absence of crystalline order. We found that because of intralayer structural mismatch, such layers are also only marginally stable against spontaneous saddle splay deformation, which is incompatible with long-range order. This results in macroscopically isotropic fluids that possess only short-range orientational and positional order, in which the only macroscopically broken symmetry is chirality—even though the phases are formed from achiral molecules. Their conglomerate domains exhibit optical rotatory powers comparable to the highest ever found for isotropic fluids of chiral molecules.
Banana-shaped molecules lacking handedness form a macroscopically isotropic fluid that still has overall chirality.

  abstract = {Liquid crystals are soft materials that combine the ﬂuidity of disordered liquids and the long range orientational or positional order of crystalline solids along one or two directions of space. X-ray scattering is widely and generally successfully used to investigate and characterize the microscopic structure of most liquid crystals. In many cases however, the Bragg reﬂections are forbidden by special symmetries of the unit cell and the low dimensional structure of the liquid crystalline phases are out of reach of conventional X-ray experiments. We show in this paper that this problem can be overcome by resonant scattering of X-rays as it reveals the anisotropy of the tensor structure factor. We review various examples in which the restored forbidden reﬂections reveal unambiguously the hidden structure of liquid crystalline phases. Moreover, we show that in some cases, a ﬁne analysis of the polarization of the Bragg reﬂections enables one to discriminate between diﬀerent structural models. These studies solved long standing questions about biaxial liquid crystal structures and provided new insights into physical phenomena such as supercritical behaviour or commensurate-incommensurate transitions.},

  abstract = {The origin of the long-range interlayer interactions responsible for the variety of phases exhibited by ferroelectric liquid crystals is discussed. It is shown that the anisotropy of the elastic constants that govern layer bending in smectic-C liquid crystals results in an effective long-range interaction between the smectic layers. The nature of this interaction is such as to favor a mutual alignment of the c directors of the layers in either a parallel or antiparallel orientation. The free energy of the system is the sum of the contributions of these long-range interlayer interactions and the short-range interaction between nearest-neighboring layers, which favors a purely helical structure for the c directors. The long-range interaction is found to favor commensurate structures while the short-range term favors incommensurate helices. The resulting structure is of the type characterized in the “distorted clock model.” The phase diagrams that result from the application of this theory are consistent with the experimentally observed phase sequences.},

The material studied is representative of a wide family of mesogens that contain silyl groups at the ends of the chains. These bulky terminal groups have been reported to give rise to smectic phases showing ferroelectric switching. However, the analysis of the SHG signal before and after application of electric fields has allowed us to establish unambiguously that the reported ferroelectricity is not intrinsic to the material but stabilized by the cell substrates once an electric field has been applied. In addition, the results obtained from resonant X-ray diffraction indicate that virgin samples have antiferroelectric undulated synclinic smectic structures.},

The theoretical model shows that in the case of a simple heliconical nematic structure, two resonant signals corresponding to the full and half pitch band should be present, while only the full pitch band is observed experimentally. This suggests that the twist-bend nematic phase has a complex structure with a double-helix built of two interlocked, shifted helices. We confirm that the helical pitch in the twist-bend nematic phase is in a 10 nm range for both the chiral and achiral materials. We also show that the symmetry of the blue phase can be unambiguously determined through a resonant enhancement of the X-ray diffraction signals, by including polarization effects, which are found to be an important indicator in phase structure determination.},

An analysis of the scattering features allows the structural models of the different subphases to be distinguished, in addition to providing a measurement of the helical pitch. This paper reports resonant scattering features in the antiferroelectric hexatic phase, the three- and four-layer intermediate phases, the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases and the SmC*α phase. The helicoidal pitch has been measured from the scattering peaks in the four-layer intermediate phase as well as in the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases. In the SmC*α phase, an investigation into the helical structure has revealed a pitch ranging from 5 to 54 layers in different materials. Further, a strong resonant scattering signal has been observed in mixtures of a selenium containing material with as much as 90\% nonresonant material.},

This powerful experimental technique utilises “forbidden reflections” to determine the subtle differences in interlayer orientation that differentiate several smectic systems. The technique relies on the materials containing an atom to which the X-ray energy can be tuned, usually sulphur or selenium. Experiments are often carried out on free-standing films that provide a highly monodomain structure that allows high-resolution measurements to be made, and, hence, structural details to be determined. Alternatively, resonant scattering has been demonstrated for materials contained in glass devices that permit the application of electric fields to the system, in a manner analogous to that used in liquid crystal devices. The resonant scattering technique provides unequivocal descriptions of the packing in smectic systems, and the way in which the packing is distorted in electric fields. This Minireview describes the principles behind resonant X-ray scattering, its application to liquid crystals and some of the potential for the future.},

  abstract = {For more than one decade, were the only three confirmed commensurate SmC* variant phases with periodicities less than or equal four layers. In 2006, employing ellipsometry and resonant X-ray diffraction (RXRD), our research team first discovered a new liquid crystal mesophase having a six-layer periodicity in one ternary mixture which includes one sulfur-containing compound. From our ellipsometric results, this phase showed antiferroelectric-like optical response. This novel discovery inspired renewed interest to search for liquid crystal mesophases with commensurate periodicities greater than four layers. Soon after, another mesophase having a six-layer structure and showing a ferrielectric-like dielectric response, instead, was uncovered by RXRD measurements on a different binary mixture which has one bromine-containing compound. Meanwhile mesophases having a 5-, 8-, 12- or 15-layer periodicity were reported. However, numerous questions remain to be addressed associated with these unusual reported phases. Theoretical models giving rise to mesophases with periodicities greater than four layers have been developed; but, to date, none of them have provided satisfactory explanations of all the physical phenomena related to the mesophases exhibiting a six-layer structure. Moreover, the question “what is the source of long-range interactions between liquid-like smectic layers, which are responsible for establishing mesophases with long periodicities and mean-field behavior of the smectic-A–smectic-C transition?” remains unanswered for more than three decades.},

  abstract = {In order to demonstrate experimentally that the competition between the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric interactions stabilizing SmC*A and SmC* (the pairing energy of the transverse dipole moments in adjacent smectic layers and the packing entropy resulting from the excluded volume effect) produces a variety of antiferroelectric and ferroelectric subphases in the temperature region between antiferroelectric SmC*A and ferroelectric SmC*, we have tried to observe the subphases in several binary mixtures of chiral smectic liquid crystals. The subphases were identified by the electric field dependence of cono- scopic figures and the apparent tilt angle as a function of field strength. Systematically changing the mixing ratio of two properly chosen compounds and studying the stability of each subphase, we have substantiated that the subphases between SmC*A and SmC* form a Devil’s staircase, SmC*A(qT). Here, qT is an irreducible rational number, which specifies a fraction of the ferroelectric ordering in the antiferroelectric ordering. We have also discussed the relationship of SmC*A(qT) to the other staircase, SmC*α(qT), that was proposed to exist as a result of the rather macroscopic, electrostatic interaction among two-dimensional spontaneous polarizations in smectic layers.},

The mesophases exhibited by these compounds have been characterized using a combination of polarized light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies. Electro-optical investigations have been carried out on several compounds and both ferroelectric and antiferroelectric properties are observed.

The SmAPAR phase shows an entirely different response compared to other polar smectic phases under study. The dielectric measurements in the SmAPAR phase is the evidence of antiferroelectric behavior of uniaxial state. The polarizing microscopy texture observation supports the corresponding biaxiality measurements.},

  abstract = {Two 4-cyanoresorcinol-derived achiral bent-core liquid crystalline materials with terephthalate wings terminated by long alkyl chains CnH2n+1, 1/n=1/16 and 1/18, are investigated. Both compounds form a paraelectric smectic phase with uniform (synclinic) molecular tilt in layers of the SmC phase composed of fluctuating polar clusters (polarization randomized SmCSPR phase). On cooling, the polar coherence length continuously grows and at the distinct phase transition from SmCSPR, a synclinic SmCSPF phase is formed. The latter turns into a heliconical phase, formed either spontaneously for 1/16 or after application of an ac field for 1/18. The helical structure has a helical axis perpendicular to the layer planes and is stable over a relatively broad range of temperatures. The spontaneously helical phase, formed by achiral molecules, is described as SmCSPhelF where S, P, F, and “hel” stand for the synclinic, polar, ferroelectric, and helical, respectively. The helical structure is confirmed by measurements of the birefringence in planar-aligned cells as well as by conoscopy in homeotropic-aligned cells with in-plane electric field. The field applied in a plane at right angles to the helix axis leads to the deformed helical ferroelectric mode, and the field dependency of the apparent tilt angle unequivocally confirms that the phase under study is helical. It is concluded that the structure of this helical phase is similar to that of the SmC∗α phase formed by permanently chiral rodlike mesogens. Due to the achiral nature of the molecules, SmCSPhelF can alternatively be considered as SmCPα phase. Since the helical pitch is approximately the same for both 1/16 and 1/18, in spite of different molecular lengths and its correspondence of the structure with SmCPα (like SmC∗α for chiral molecules) the helical pitch is suggested to be incommensurate with the integral number of the layers. The relationship of this mirror-symmetry-broken polar helical phase with an apolar twist bend smectic phase of mesogenic dimers is also discussed.},
