\chapter{The Discovery of Helicity in Tilted Bent-Core Smectics: \smcpalpha{}}

The interplay between polarization and chirality has always been front and
centre in the developlment of the bananna phases of liquid crystals. From the
short-range (bilayer) chiral B2 phases\cite{link_spontaneous_1997}, to the
long-range helicity of the twist-bend nematic phase, bent-core liquid crystals
have been an interesting playground to observe the emergence of spontaneous
chirality.

Our discovery of a B2-like phase, with polar, ferrieletric switching that also
has a spontaneous twist-bend like helix is the first link between the
twist-bend and B2 phases.



\section{A Brief History of Chirality in Bent-Core Smectics}


\subsection{Conventional Phase of \nfour{phi}}

To briefly recap Section~\ref{test}, the low-temperature phases of \nfour{} are conventional B2
phases: the \smcapa{} and the \smcapf{}. 
The conventional representation of the polarization current for the Sm3 and Sm4
phases are shown in \autoref{fig:pal30:sm34:prc1}.

\end{figure}
However, it the switching dynamics of the phases become more clear if the
polarization current is plotted directly against the driving voltage, shown in
\autoref{fig:pal30:sm34:prc2}

\section{Characteristics of the \smcpalpha{} phase}



\subsection{The \nfour{} Molecule and Phases}
\todo{add phase description with Sm2} Go bottom up, to get the boring phases out
of the way. (maybe put this in the introduction of \nfour{})
\subsection{Textures of the \smcpalpha{} phase}
\subsubsection{Planar Aligned Textures}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro:pl-aligned}, in planar-aligned cells, the
optic axis of the liquid crystal is perpendicular to the $\vec{k}$ of the
applied light--meaning we will be sensitive to relative orientations of the
long-axis.

In \autoref{fig:pal30:planar-textures}, the planar textures of the Sm2 phase of \nfour{} are shown.
Comparing these with previously published textures reveals a strong similarity
to the \smcapa{}
phases\cite{link_spontaneous_1997,ReddyInfluencefluorinesubstituent2003}. As
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro:pal30-phases}, the \nfour{} phase directly below the
Sm2 is a \smcapa{}, but with strikingly long-range and regular conglomerate
chiral structure, where the handedness is grouped together into stripes. There
exists no clear phase transition in the textures between the Sm2 and Sm3 in
planar aligned cells.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/pal30/textureSM2/sm2Textures100.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pal30:planar-textures} Textures of the \smcpalpha{}
    phase of \nfour{}: reminiscent of a \smcapa{} texture.  }
\end{figure}

This similarity is due to the fact that, broadly, the \smcapa{} and
\smcpalpha{} phases are identical optically. Both phases have unit-cells whose dielectric tensor is uniaxial (where
the $\epsilon_{xx} = \epsilon_{yy}$), so the optic axis will be parallel to the
layer normal and the texture appears like a SmA in it's ground state.

Both phases are polar, so with a high enough field both states will switch into
an aligned \smcspf{} state, which gives a birefringent contrast between domains with different handedness. This contrast is
because of the synclinic nature of the \smcspf{} phase--- because the tilt is
now aligned between the subsequent layers, the phase can organize into
conglomerate chiral domains with the optic axis tilted with respect to the layer
normal.
\todo{figure describing this switching mechanism}

We can directly measure the optical tilt in the switched state, by simply
rotating the stage when a field has been applied such that an initially dark
stripe becomes completely bright. The angle of this rotation is
$2\theta_{opt}$. To observe the tilt dyanamics, we have to extend this analysis
as we cannot rotate a stage at the \SI{20}{\hertz} frequency that these samples
usually switch at.

We can extract a measurement of the dynamic optical tilt, $\theta_\textrm{opt}$, by
examining the contrast between the bright and dark regions of the stripe.
Knowing that the brightness of a birefringent material viewed under cross
polarizers is $I \propto \sin(2\theta)^2 $, the contrast between a ``bright''
and adjacent ``dark'' stripe is given by:
\begin{align}
    C = \delta I = I_\textrm{bright} - I_\textrm{dark} &= \sin(2\theta_b)^2 -
    \sin(2\theta_d)^2 \\
&= \frac{1-\cos(4\theta_b)}{2} - \frac{1-\cos(4\theta_d)}{2} \\
&= -\sin(2i(\theta_d+\theta_b))\sin(2(\theta_d-\theta_b))
\end{align}

Because of the symmetry of the \smcspf{} state, we know that $\theta_d
=-\theta_b$ (the magnitude of the tilt is equal, but the sign depends on the
chirality).

This allows to directly connect the contrast with the tilt angle:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:contrast-tilt}
    C \propto\sin(4\theta_\textrm{opt}).
\end{align}

This analysis assumes that the state we are measuring can be roughly
approximated by a \smcspf{}. This will be a good approximation at high field
strengths, but may be false at lower fields, where the helix of the \smcpalpha
phase may be distorted, but not switched.

Plotting the result in \autoref{fig:pcVtilt} we see thresholdless optical
switching, where the contrast (optical tilt) increases linearly with applied
field. Interestingly, the \smcpalpha phase accesses a `dark' state, which was
also seen in homeotropic cells, shown in \autoref{fig:pal30:homeo}. This will be
discussed in further detail in \autoref{sec:pal30:discussion}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figs/pal30/prc/PRCvsTilt/T108.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pcVtilt} Dynamic optical tilt of \smcpalpha{}. On
    application of a field, the state briefly passes through a `dark' state,
where the contrast decreases.}
\end{figure}


In conclusion, the textures of the \smcpalpha{} phase have identical
characteristics to those of the \smcapa{}, though an interesting dark state
emerges when viewed under dynamic conditions. 

\subsubsection{Homeotropic Aligned Textures}
Though we were unable to achieve good homeotropic alignment, we can rely on the
published results of the Dublin group, who published a series of papers on the
\nfour{} homolog
series\cite{panarin_sequence_2011,sreenilayam_properties_2012,SreenilayamOccurrenceFiveDifferent2015,sreenilayam_spontaneous_2016}.
Though their interpretation is wrong (\nfour{} is not an orthogonal phase), they
report beautifully aligned homeotropic textures and study the response of these
textures to an applied in-plane electric field. These textures are reproduced from Sreenilayam et
al\cite{sreenilayam_properties_2012} in \autoref{fig:pal30:homeo}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figs/pal30/fromPapers/textures/pal30-Homeo-2012-labelled.png}
    \caption{ \label{fig:pal30:homeo} Homeotropic textures of \nfour{}. The relevant temperatures for the Sm2 phases are \SI{104}{\degreeCelsius}, and \SI{98}{\degreeCelsius}. The biaxiality in the Sm2 is distinguished by a small `hump' with small applied field, that gets larger on cooling, and changes in character on cooling through the Sm2$\rightarrow$Sm3 phase transition at \SI{99}{\degreeCelsius}, where it broadens. Reproduced from Sreenilayam et al\cite{sreenilayam_properties_2012}.}
\end{figure}


The phase of interest, \smcpalpha, occurs in the temperature range \SIrange{110}{99}{\degreeCelsius}. There is a clear change in the field-behaviour of the biaxiality at the Sm2$\rightarrow$Sm3 transition temperature. However, because these phases are tilted the authors original interpretation of the data needs to be revisited.  

For our purposes, we can use these textures to distinguish the \smcpalpha{} phase
from the closely related \smcapa{} phase. The \smcapa{} phase should be weakly
biaxial in homeotropic cells. The anticlinic structure should 'average' out any
anisotropy in the dieletric tensor due to the tilt of the molecule, but because
these are bent-core phases, there is a built in anisotropy of the dielectric
tensor due to the rotation symmetry breaking of the bananna structure, which
should manifest in homeotropic cells as a schlieren texture that allows for $\pm
1/2$ defects.

From \autoref{fig:pal30:homeo}, it is clear that, for the temperature ranges of
\smcpalpha, the textures appear dark-- they have no measurable biaxiality. This
means that the inherent anisotropy of the dielectric tensor of the molecule
\textit{must} be organized in a structure that averages it out. This is a clue
to the helical nature of the \smcpalpha{}. 



%The original interpretation, that there exists a `dark' intermediate state on application of the electric field ($\approx \SI{2}{\volts\per\micron}$), where the polarization of each layer is perpendicular to each other.
        
\subsection{Electro-Optic Behaviour of the \smcpalpha{} phase}
We can study the electro-optic behaviour of \nfour{} in both homeotropic and
planar aligned cells. In homeotropic, you are studying the \textit{biaxiality}
of the phase, ie. the birefringence $\delta n = n_2-n_3$. In planar aligned
cells, you are studying the birefringence between the molecules long axis and
some weighted combination of $n_2$ and $n_3$ that depends on the orientation.

There are two categories of behaviour you can track to get information about the
phase: the polarization current and the bifrefringence/biaxility.

\subsubsection{Polarization Current}
The \smcpalpha{} phase manifests a slight ferrielectric behaviour, where three
peaks are visible under a high resolution polarization current trace. Broadly,
the phase appears to have two main peaks, usually associated with
antiferroelectric behaviour.

However, the differences between these two phases becomes apparent under the
application of an electric field. This is because the sequence of intermediate
phases between a \smcapa{}$\rightarrow$\smcspf{} is different from
\smcpalpha{}$\rightarrow$\smcspf{}. If the bent-core \smcpalpha{} phase behaves
like its calamitic cousin, the \smcalpha{}, then under application of a field
perpendicular to the helical axis, the helix of the \smcpalpha{} distorts. This
helical distortion is likely causing the three peaks visible in
\autoref{fig:pal30:sm2:prc2}

A more conventional series of traces for the polarization current is shown in
\autoref{fig:pal30:sm2:prc1}, where the current is plotted as a function of
time. The same data is shown in \autoref{fig:pal30:sm2:prc2}, where the
current is plotted directly against the applied voltage.

\subsection{Freely-Suspended Films of the \smcpalpha{} phase}
\subsection{X-ray Analysis of the \smcpalpha{} phase}

The two techniques used to characterize the \smcpalpha phase were SAXS (small
angle hard x-ray scattering) and RSoXS (resonant soft x-ray scattering). As the
SAXS is sensitive to periodicity in electron density, we can directly measure
the smectic layer size ($d$), as shown in \autoref{fig:pal30:saxs}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/pal30/xraysm1/sm2-saxs-annote.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pal30:saxs} SAXS of \smcpalpha{}. The smectic layer
    size, $d$, increases monotonically on cooling, with no inflection points
that would be characteristic of a untilted$\rightarrow$tilted phase transition.}
\end{figure}

The smectic layer size is measurably smaller than the length of an extended
molecule, which supports the classification of \smcpalpha{} as a tilted phase.
However, the increase seen on cooling, which stands in contrast to the
majority of bent-core materials, may indicate a significant amount of
intercalation at higher temperatures.  

The x-ray analysis can be greatly supplemented with the addition of resonant
scattering, which is sensitive to periodicity in orientation. A resonant diffractogram
taken at \SI{104}{\degreeCelsius} is shown in \autoref{fig:pal30:diffract}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figs/pal30/rsoxssm2/RSoXS-coexistanenceDiffracto.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pal30:diffract} Diffractogram of \nfour{} taken in the
        coexistance region between the \smcpalpha{} ($q\approx
        \SI{0.04}{\per\angstrom}$) and the \smcapa{} ($q\approx
    \SI{0.06}{\per\angstrom}$).}
\end{figure}

By azimuthally averaging diffractograms like the one in
\autoref{fig:pal30:diffract} and plotting them as a function of temperature,
\autoref{fig:pal30:diffractVt}, the
behaviour of the \smcpalpha phase can be determined over its entire temperature
range.

    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figs/pal30/rsoxssm2/sm2-rsoxs.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pal30:diffractVt} Temperature behaviour of the
    \smcpalpha{} phase plotted as a waterfall plot in (a), and as a contour plot
    in (b). A bilayer ($d=\SI{112}{\angstrom} =2d_0$) corresponds to the 2-layer
unit-cell structure of the \smcapa{} phase, which sits directly below the
\smcpalpha phase in temperature. The resonant peak corresponding to the
\smcpalpha{} phase at $d\approx\SI{150}{\angstrom}$ is direct evidence that the
\smcpalpha{} phase is not a classic B2-type phase.}
\end{figure}

The resonant peak corresponding to the \smcpalpha{} phase
($d=\approx\SI{150}{\angstrom}$) shows that this phase cannot be a B2 phase (as
those only have one or two layer unit-cells. However, the fact that this feature
appears at roughly three times the smectic layer spacing is neccesary but not
sufficient for a helix. An example of this type of structure would be the
proposed devil-staircase model put forth to explain a similiar phase in
\smcstar{} phase family of calimitics.

Though a detailed examination of the unit-cell structure of the \smcpalpha{}
will have to wait on the advent of polarization-resolved resonant x-ray on the
carbon K-edge, we can actually confirm the helical nature of the \smcpalpha{}
phase through careful analysis.

\subsubsection{Umklapp Peaks}

Though a detailed examination of the unit-cell structure of the \smcpalpha{}
will have to wait on the advent of polarization-resolved resonant x-ray on the
carbon K-edge, we can actually confirm the helical nature of the \smcpalpha{}
phase through careful analysis. By combining the SAXS data and the RSoXS data,
we can deduce two things. First, that the resonant feature of the \smcpalpha{}
phase is incommensurate with the underlying smectic layer spacing. Specifically,
it has a unit cell thickness of $\SI{148}{\angstrom}\approx 2.8 d_0$. Second,
that we are missing an expected umklapp (harmonic) peak.

Umklapp is a german word meaning flip-over, and it refers to higher harmonics
that are wrapped back into the Brioullon zone. Following Levulet and
Pansu~\cite{levelut1999tensorial}, where the smectic layers are modeled as
stacked tensorial slabs, the master equation that predicts these flip-over
harmonics is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:levelut}
\frac{q}{q_0} = 2 \pi l + 2 \pi m\frac{1}{p},\qquad \forall \: l \in \mathbb{N},
\quad \forall\: m
\in \mathbb{Z}
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the location of the expected harmonic, $q_0$ is the scattering off
the smectic layer spacing, $p$ is the pitch (in units of the smectic layer
spacing) of the unit-cell, $l$ is a positive integer, and $m$ is a positive or
negative integer.

From \autoref{eq:levelut}, we can see one of the nearest harmonics should occur
at $l=1,m=-1$. For the \smcpalpha{} phase, with a pitch of $p =1/2.8$, we would
expect to see a harmonic at \todo{include this number}. To highlight this
analysis, we plot the azimuthally-averaged diffractogram in the co-existence
region between the \smcpalpha{} and the \smcapa{}, on a $q$-scale
normalized by the scattering from the smectic layer spacing, $q_0$, in
\autoref{fig:pal30-xray-combined}.

    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/pal30/rsoxssm2/xray-combined.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:pal30-xray-combined}X-ray scattering from \nfour{phi}.
            (a) SAXS gives a peak from the smectic layer ordering at $q=q_0$.
                The RSoXS peak at $q_H$ indicates that there is superlayer
            orientational ordering with periodicity $d_H$
                in the Sm2 phase.
                    In general, superlayer orientational modulation in a smectic
                generates RSoXS peaks at wavevectors along the layer normal at
                    $q(l,m) = l(2\pi/d_0) \pm
                m(2\pi/d_H)$\cite{levelut1999tensorial}.  The
                    observation of an RSoXS reflection at $q = q(0,1)$ and the
                absence of an Umklapp peak at $q = q(1,-1)$  in
                    the Sm2 confirms a superlayer helix with a scattering
                amplitude
                    modulation due to the smectic layering that is undetectably
                weak.

                peak at $q_H \approx1/(2.8 d_0)$ becomes diffuse in the Sm3

                of the bilayer peak at $q_B$, which would indicate helical
            precession of the bilayer structure, is not observed.}

%\section{Introduction and Context}
%\nfour{phi}, the compound were we discovered bent-core, smectic helicity was orignally
%investigated by the Dublin group, with an interest towards developing a new
%bent-core display, based around orthogonal phases. Because a helical, tight-pitch,
%orthogonal phase will appear dark in homeotropic alignment, but still have a
%fast field response, it would make for an ideal display.

%
%Serving as an excellent example of scientific irony, the Dublin group, though
%completely correct about the exotic tight-pitch helix of \nfour{phi},
%mischaracterized the phase as being orthogonal. A cursory look at the
%planar-aligned textures in Figure~\ref{fig:textures} shows that
%\nfour{phi} reveals chiral (therefore tilted) phases under application of a
%field in planar-aligned cells.
%
%Because the Dublin's group original analysis was based on: constructing a list
%of possible orthogonal phases (the \smapf{}, the \smapa{}, the \smap2{}, the
%\smapalpha{} and the
%\smapr{} phases); then ruling them out one by one based on the behaviour of
%the observed \nfour{} phase, the fact that \nfour{} is tilted means that their
%identification of a tight-pitch phase was right for the wrong reasons.
%
%Unfortunately, because \nfour{} is \textit{not} tilted, this removes it from
%being a potential switching material.

%\subsection{Optical Texture Analysis}
%The optical textures of planar-aligned (bookshelf) cells of
%\nfour{phi} were studied using PLM.
%Upon cooling from the isotropic, the Sm1 phase grows in (at \SI{175}{\degreeCelsius})
%as b\^{a}tonnets, giving a smooth, focal-conic texture typical of an orthogonal fluid smectic (Figure~\ref{fig:main}(f)).
%However, given the large value of the estimated
%molecular tilt, $\theta_\textrm{xray}$, the Sm1 is probably a de Vries
%smectic.
%In planar-aligned cells, there is no observable field-induced change of the in-plane birefringence, $\Delta n= n_\parallel
%-n_\perp$, in small applied electric fields  (Figure~\ref{fig:main}(f)),
%or in the optic axis orientation, $\theta_\text{opt}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:threshold}).
%

%\end{figure}
%
%
%Below \SI{115}{\degreeCelsius}, a threshold field, $E_\text{th}$, above which a first-order structural change marked by the appearance of chiral conglomerate domains occurs, becomes experimentally accessible.
%These domains are polar and exhibit a uniform, saturated optic axis tilt on the
%order of $\theta_{\rm opt} \approx \SI{18}{\degree}$ from the layer normal, implying that the achiral, untilted Sm1 phase
%transforms in the field to a B2-like, homochiral \smcspf{phi} state (Figure
%S1(c))~\cite{eremin2008electrically}. The field-induced left- and right-handed domains form a ``tiger stripe''
%pattern (Figures~\ref{fig:main}(e,g)). The local domain handedness in this unusual conglomerate texture 
%is apparently locked in after the first few field cycles.  This bias is due to a chiral
%memory effect at the surface since, as
%Figures~\ref{fig:main}(d)~and~\ref{fig:threshold} show, the
%sub-threshold bulk state has an achiral field response, with a linear polarization current (implying $P \propto E$) and no
%detectable reorientation of the optical tilt.
%$E_\text{th}$  decreases strongly on cooling as the transition to the Sm2 phase is approached, as shown in the inset of Figure~\ref{fig:threshold}.

%
%In the lower part of the Sm1, and throughout the Sm2, Sm3 and Sm4 phases, the birefringence increases on application of an electric field, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:main}(c),  changing from yellow to orange.
%Measurements of $\Delta n$ at $E = 0$ and $E = \SI{20}{\volt\per\micro\metre}$
%(Figures~\ref{fig:main}(c) and S6),
%show that the birefringences in the lower temperature
%phases with and without an applied field are of the order of $\Delta n_\text{on} \sim 0.12$ and $\Delta n_\text{off} \sim 0.10$.
%Assuming that the field-on \smcspf{phi} state
%(Figures~\ref{fig:main}(n--p) and S1) gives a uniform
%director orientation with the optic axis in the plane of the cell, then $\Delta
%n \sim 0.12$ would correspond to the maximal birefringence $n_3-n_1$ of the
%\smcspf{phi} state. Modeling the bent-core molecule
%as two uniaxial, birefringent rods connected with an opening angle of
%$\Psi$, and tilting this molecule from $z$ by an angle $\theta$,
%we have calculated the birefringence of all of the states shown in
%Figure~\ref{fig:main}. If the Sm1 phase is assumed to be a de Vries SmA, with
%azimuthally averaged molecules distributed on a tilt cone of angle
%$\theta$, the best fit to the measured birefringence values $\Delta n_\text{on}$ and $\Delta n_\text{off}$ is
%obtained with $\Psi = \SI{150}{\degree}$ and $\theta = \SI{15}{\degree}$.
%The calculated birefringence as a function of temperature is shown in Figure~S6.
%
%
%
%The transitions between the smectic phases are difficult to see when $E=0$ because they are all orthogonal in appearance,
%with an optic axis along $z$, and have similar birefringence.
%At the transition from Sm1 to the Sm2 phase,  however, arbitrarily small electric fields induce molecular tilt in the
%(Figure~\ref{fig:threshold}), leading to the formation of optically distinct, conglomerate chiral
%domains with opposite tilt (Figures~\ref{fig:main}(h--j)), again
%corresponding to a field-induced transition to a \smcspf{phi} state.
%The birefringence and orthogonal appearance of the Sm2 ground state are consistent with
%the helical superlayer structure indicated by RSoXS.
%
%The texture and birefringence of the Sm3 phase in the absence of field are consistent with the \smcapa{phi} bilayer structure indicated by RSoXS.
%The field-induced conglomerate domain morphology in both the Sm2 and Sm3 phases is distinct from that of the undulating Sm1
%tiger stripes, with straight
%domain boundaries that tend to form parallel to the layers, as in an
%antiferroelectric calamitic being driven to a ferroelectric
%state~\cite{li1995reversible}.
%The optical tilt in these domains is found to be $\theta_\mathrm{opt}\sim 18^\circ$.
%
%The response to applied field changes dramatically again at
%the transition from Sm3 to Sm4, with no visible brush rotation or evidence of domain formation at any $E$. The birefringence in the Sm4 phase increases continuously with field, saturating
%at a value comparable to that observed in the field-induced Sm2 and Sm3 conglomerate domains.
%
%\nfour{phi} transitions into a SmA-like phase from the isotropic phase at
%\SI{174}{\degreeCelsius}. This phase is optically confirmed to be smectic as
%the smectic layer undulations give rise to characteristic stripes parallel
%to the layer normal. These smectic domains grow in as batonnets \nt{fix accent},
% which is again, characteristic to SmA phases. Further cooling results in
% the development of ``tiger stripe'' textures on application of high fields
% (fields larger than some temperature dependent threshold voltage).
%
% These ``tiger stripe'' textures are unique to the \nfour{phi} molecule, and
% are characterized by wavy undulations of alternating bright and dark
% regions that form parallel to the smectic layers. Though the specific
% dynamics that set the size of these tiger stripes is currently unknown,
% they are thought to form during a transition to chirality, that will be
% discussed in more detail.

%The polarization reversal current, measured with a triangular
%applied field, is shown vs.\ temperature in Figures~\ref{fig:main}(d) and
%S7. Upon cooling from the isotropic, a single current bump centered
%about $E=0$ first appears at lower temperatures in the Sm1 phase, indicating a Langevin-type
%field-induced orientation of $\mathbf{P}$, with a linear response near $E=0$
%and the current vanishing  when $\mathbf{P}$ becomes saturated (for $E \ge E_\text{sat}$).
%Significantly, $E_\text{sat}$ is similar in magnitude to $E_\text{th}$, the threshold
%field required for the Sm1
%transition to chirality observed optically (Figure~\ref{fig:threshold}, inset), indicating that the
%field first orders the Langevin system of initially azimuthally random molecular
%polarizations, with the Sm1 remaining in an achiral state, and that the phase becomes
%chiral only at higher fields, once $\mathbf{P}$ is saturated (Figure S8). Upon entering the
%Sm2, this polarization bump splits into three peaks roughly centered about
%$E=0$, coalescing into two peaks on cooling through the Sm3.
%\nfour{phi} thus transforms on cooling from the non-polar
%Langevin ground state of the Sm1, where $P=0$ is enforced by entropy, to energetically stabilized ground
%states in which the spatial average of
%$\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{r})$ in the absence of applied field is also zero: the incommensurate helical winding of the
%polarization
%in the Sm2, and the antiferroelectric bilayer structure in the Sm3. At the
%transition to the Sm4, a single, broad current peak reappears, characteristic of the block
%polarization switching of a ferroelectric ground state that is surface-stabilized
%with $\mathbf{P}$ parallel to the cell plates at $E=0$, such as occurs in the orthorhombic \smapf{phi} phase~\cite{shen2011effective}.
%The absence of brush rotation during the field-induced reorientation of the
%polarization in Sm4 is consistent with achiral \smcapf{phi} superlayer organization.

%\subsection{X-Ray Scattering}
%-- another figure highlighting the tiger stripes
%Undoubtably, the most powerful probe in revealing the nanoscale structure of
%these phases of matter is light, specifically, light small enough to resolve
%this nanoscale structure: X-rays. (digression on Rayleigh resolution/scattering theory?)
%
%For the characterization of PAL30, we used both Small Angle X-ray Scattering
%(SAXS) and Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering (RSoXS). For the SAXS, we used the
%Synctron Source at ZZ, confirming these diffractograms with a ZZ (in house)
%source, shown in Figure XX.

%As SAXS reveals the underlying electron density structure, it is a powerful,
%though oftentimes, blunt tool for revealing the phase structure. For PAL30, we
%observed only a single Bragg peak at $\approx \SI{50}{\angstrom}$. The absence
%of harmonic peaks indicate that the underlying electron density is very close to
%being perfectly sinusoidal, allowing for decomposition into a singular Fourier
%wavelength which corresponds to the smectic layer spacing.

%\subsection{Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering}
%Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), as discussed in
%Section~\ref{sec:int-rsoxs}, is sensitive to periodicities in the orientation of
%the underlying molecules. The RSoXS scans for PAL30 were carried out by Dr.
%Michael Tuchband at the Synctron Source in Berkeley.
%\nt{include relevant preamble from the supplement about the Berekely facilities}
%X-ray scattering from \nfour{phi} is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:main}(b) and S3.
%Upon  cooling from the isotropic, a single, non-resonant SAXS peak
%appears at $\SI{175}{\degreeCelsius}$, at a wavevector $q_0$  corresponding to Bragg scattering from
%the smectic layers in the Sm1 phase with spacing $d_0 = 2\pi/q_0
%= \SI{48}{\angstrom}$. The layer spacing increases slightly on cooling
%to the crystal phase at \SI{65}{\degreeCelsius} and is
%consistently smaller than the calculated molecular length, $l = \SI{59.9}{\angstrom}$, throughout this temperature range, suggesting that the molecules are tilted in all of the smectic phases, to first order by an average amount estimated using $\theta_\textrm{xray} =
%\cos(d_0/l)$ of $\SI{33}{\degree}$ (see Figure~S4).
%In the Sm1 temperature range ($\SI{110}{\degreeCelsius} \leq T \leq
%\SI{175}{\degreeCelsius}$), there are no RSoXS scattering features that would indicate a
%superlayer periodic structure (see Figure~S2 and the Supplemental video).
%
%At the transition to the Sm2 phase, at $\SI{110}{\degreeCelsius}$, marked  by
%a distinct enthalpy peak in the DSC (Figure~S5
%), a single, sharp
%resonant peak appears at $q_H = \SI[per-mode=reciprocal]{.042}{\per\angstrom}$, corresponding
%to a molecular orientational structure with a period
%$d_H=\SI{148}{\angstrom}\approx 2.8 d_0$ that is incommensurate with the
%smectic layer spacing (Figure~\ref{fig:xray-results}(b)). Below
%$\SI{104}{\degreeCelsius}$, this reflection
%becomes weaker and another sharp, resonant reflection at higher $q$ grows in, the coexistence
%indicating a first-order transition to the Sm3 phase.
%This second Bragg peak, which persists down to the crystal phase, has a
%wavevector $q_B\approx q_0/2$, indicative of a commensurate, bilayer orientational
%structure in the Sm3 and Sm4 phases.
%%
%Below \SI{99}{\degreeCelsius}, the incommensurate peak broadens dramatically and
%moves to higher $q$, indicating the presence of short-ranged, Sm2-like helical
%fluctuations persisting in the Sm3 phase, and disappears at the transition to the Sm4
%phase at \SI{83}{\degreeCelsius}. The Sm4 phase exhibits only the bilayer RSoXS
%reflection at $q_B$.

%        The RSoXS peak at $q_H$ indicates that there is superlayer orientational ordering with periodicity $d_H$
%        in the Sm2 phase.
%        In general, superlayer orientational modulation in a smectic generates RSoXS peaks at wavevectors along the layer normal at
%        $q(l,m) = l(2\pi/d_0) \pm m(2\pi/d_H)$\cite{levelut1999tensorial}.  The
%        observation of an RSoXS reflection at $q = q(0,1)$ and the absence of an Umklapp peak at $q = q(1,-1)$  in

%        modulation due to the smectic layering that is undetectably weak.

%        }
%\end{figure}
%
%
%The RSoXS scattering from a single layer can be analyzed, following Levelut and
%Pansu, in terms of a monoclinic second-rank tensor with a principal
%axis tilted from and then azimuthally rotated about the layer normal~\cite{levelut1999tensorial,gleeson_resonant_2006,Barois2012review}.   Scattering
%from a stack of such layers is calculated by summing over the contributions of the individual layers at different $z$.
%Resonant scattering peaks from azimuthally
%periodic arrangements are found at wavevectors along $z$, $q(l,m) = l(2\pi/d_0)
%\pm m(2\pi/p)$, where $p$ is the pitch.  In principle, resonant
%scattering should appear at all values of $l$ (harmonics of $q_0$), and at values
%of $m=0,\pm1,\pm2$ that depend on the superlayer structure.  In an incommensurate, helical
%structure, like the SmC$_\alpha$ phase, only the fundamental and harmonic peaks at
%$q(l=0,m=+1,+2)$ and the Umklapp peaks at
%$q(l=+1,m=-1,-2)$ are found in the range $0 < q(l,m) <
%q_0$. If the resonant scatterers are confined to lie precisely on layers spaced
%by $d_0$, then the intensities of these peaks will be identical~\cite{levelut1999tensorial}.
%Out-of-layer molecular positional fluctuations, and, in particular,
%those for which there is a coupled azimuthal orientation that keeps the molecule
%on the helix, $\delta \phi = (2\pi/p)\delta z$, reduce the intensities of the
%resonant harmonic peak
%at $2q_H$ and of the Umklapp peaks at $q_0 \pm q_H$, relative to that of the fundamental at
%$q_H$~\cite{levelut1999tensorial}. In our RSoXS scans of these peaks, only the
%fundamental is seen above the background, so that only the upper limit of
%the intensity ratio of the Umklapp and fundamental peaks
%can be estimated. From the RSoXS heating scan of
%Figure~\ref{fig:xray-results}(a), we find $I_\text{U}/I_\text{F} \lesssim 0.03$, implying a very
%weak fractional modulation of the density of helical scatterers, $\rho$, due to fluctuations in the
%smectic layering $\sqrt{\langle\delta\rho^2\rangle}/\rho_0 < 0.17$. The absence of the harmonic peaks places a similar limit on how much the density modulation of helical scatterers deviates from being purely sinusoidal.
